Maybe you were adopted. Doc, look, all we need is a little plutonium. Ahh. Look me up when you get there, guess I'll be about 47. Oh, pleased to meet you, Calvin Marty Klein. Do you mind if I sit here?

Right, I got it. I'm telling the truth, Doc, you gotta believe me. What you got under here? Good morning, Mom. What?

Marty, one rejection isn't the end of the world. I can't believe you loaned me a car, without telling me it had a blindspot. I could've been killed. Aw yeah, everything is great. This is more serious than I thought. Apparently your mother is amorously infatuated with you instead of your father. Well, because George, nice girls get angry when guys take advantage of them.

Huh? It's a board with wheels. What? I need fuel. Go ahead, quick, get in the car. Yeah well look, Marvin, Marvin, you gotta play. See that's where they kiss for the first time on the dance floor. And if there's no music, they can't dance, and if they can't dance, they can't kiss, and if they can't kiss, they can't fall in love and I'm history.

Marty, why are you so nervous? Oh yes sir. Bear with me, Marty, all of your questions will be answered. Roll tape, we'll proceed. Let's get him. We never would have fallen in love.
